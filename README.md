A C++ header-only library for parsing and executing text-based flowcharts. FlowGraph provides a simple, embeddable flowchart execution engine designed for games and applications that need dynamic workflow capabilities.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Header-only**: Easy integration with just `#include`
- **ExpressionKit Integration**: Complete expression evaluation using the powerful ExpressionKit library
- **Type-safe**: Strong typing system with compile-time validation
- **Modular**: Each `.flow` file is an independent, reusable module
- **Embeddable**: Designed for easy integration into games and applications
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile platforms
- **Rich Expression Support**: Arithmetic, boolean logic, string operations, and mathematical functions

## Quick Start

```cpp
#include "flowgraph/FlowGraph.hpp"

// Load and execute a flow
FlowGraph::FlowGraphEngine engine;
auto flow = engine.loadFlow("path/to/workflow.flow");
auto result = flow.execute();
```

## FlowGraph Format

FlowGraph uses a simple text-based format for describing workflows with powerful expression support:

```
TITLE: User Authentication

PARAMS:
S username
S password

RETURNS:
B success
S token

NODES:
10 PROC check_user username>>login exists<<found
20 COND found
30 PROC generate_token username>>user token<<auth_token
40 ASSIGN B success true
50 ASSIGN S message "Login " + (success ? "successful" : "failed")

FLOW:
START -> 10
10 -> 20
20.Y -> 30
20.N -> 40
30 -> 40
40 -> 50
50 -> END
```

### Expression Support

FlowGraph integrates [ExpressionKit](https://github.com/Cloudage/ExpressionKit) for complete expression evaluation:

**Arithmetic Operations:**
- `2 + 3 * 4` → `14`
- `(a + b) / c` → Dynamic calculation
- `-x` → Unary negation

**Boolean Logic:**
- `flag && (count > 5)` → Logical AND
- `!active || ready` → Logical OR with NOT
- `a > b && b <= c` → Comparison chains

**String Operations:**
- `"Hello, " + name + "!"` → String concatenation
- `status == "active"` → String comparison

**Mathematical Functions:**
- `sqrt(16)` → `4` (Square root)
- `max(a, b)` → Maximum value
- `min(x, y)` → Minimum value
- `abs(-5)` → `5` (Absolute value)
- `sin(3.14159/2)` → `1` (Trigonometric functions)

**Variable Access:**
- Simple variables: `count`, `username`, `active`
- Dot notation: `player.health`, `config.timeout`

See [FileFormat.md](FileFormat.md) for the complete specification.

## Installation

FlowGraph supports three integration methods to fit different project needs:

### Method 1: Header Package (Standalone)

Download a pre-built header package for simple integration:

```bash
# Generate standalone package
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --target create_package

# Copy headers to your project
cp -r build/flowgraph-1.0.0/include/ /path/to/your/project/

# Include in your code
#include "flowgraph/FlowGraph.hpp"
```

### Method 2: CMake FetchContent (Recommended)

Automatic dependency resolution with CMake:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  FlowGraph
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/Cloudage/FlowGraph.git
  GIT_TAG main
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(FlowGraph)

target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE FlowGraph::FlowGraph)
```

### Method 3: System Installation

Install FlowGraph system-wide for use with find_package:

```bash
# Install FlowGraph
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build

# Use in your project
find_package(FlowGraph REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE FlowGraph::FlowGraph)
```

### Swift Package Manager

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Cloudage/FlowGraph.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

For detailed integration examples, see [examples/integration/](examples/integration/).

## Building and Testing

```bash
# Configure and build
cmake -B build
cmake --build build

# Run tests
ctest --test-dir build
```
