# FlowGraph Development Phase 2

## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on implementing a desktop editor as a new target to facilitate debugging, validation, and visualization of FlowGraph execution. This editor will be essential for development and testing workflows while keeping the core FlowGraph library lightweight and dependency-free.

## Goals

1. **Visual Debugging**: Provide visual debugging capabilities for FlowGraph execution
2. **Step-by-Step Inspection**: Enable step-by-step execution inspection
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Offer a user-friendly interface for graph construction and testing
4. **Core Library Integrity**: Keep the core FlowGraph library lightweight and dependency-free
5. **Cross-Platform Support**: Support all major desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Architecture Design

### Editor Implementation

- **UI Framework**: Dear ImGui
  - Lightweight and suitable for debugging tools
  - Immediate mode GUI perfect for real-time data visualization
  - Single-process architecture enables direct debugging of core code
  - Well-tested and mature ecosystem

### Platform Requirements

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Platform-Native Rendering Backends**:
  - **macOS**: Metal backend (OpenGL is deprecated on macOS)
  - **Windows**: DirectX 11 backend (mature and widely supported)
  - **Linux**: OpenGL 3.3 backend (best compatibility across distributions)
- **IMPORTANT**: Use Dear ImGui's provided rendering backends
  - Do NOT implement custom rendering backends
  - Use existing well-tested backends: `imgui_impl_metal.cpp`, `imgui_impl_dx11.cpp`, `imgui_impl_opengl3.cpp`

### Efficient Rendering Strategy

- **On-Demand Rendering**: Implement instead of continuous frame updates
- **Redraw Triggers**:
  - User interaction (mouse/keyboard input)
  - Graph state changes
  - Debug stepping occurs
- **Power Efficiency**: Use `glfwWaitEvents()` or similar to reduce CPU/GPU usage
- **Performance Target**: 0% CPU/GPU usage when idle
- **Avoid**: Unnecessary high refresh rate rendering (no 120fps constant updates)

### Graph Layout Library

- **Optional Header-Only Library**: Create `flowgraph_layout/` directory
  - Separate from core FlowGraph to maintain zero dependencies
  - Implement common graph layout algorithms (hierarchical, force-directed, etc.)
  - Can be used by the editor or any other visualization tools
  - Header-only design for easy integration

## Dependency Management

### CMake FetchContent Strategy

```cmake
if(BUILD_EDITOR)
  include(FetchContent)
  
  # Dear ImGui (includes all platform backends)
  FetchContent_Declare(
    imgui
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git
    GIT_TAG v1.90.1
  )
  
  # GLFW for windowing
  FetchContent_Declare(
    glfw
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git
    GIT_TAG 3.3.8
  )
  
  # Platform-specific graphics dependencies
  if(APPLE)
    # Metal is included in system frameworks
    find_library(METAL_FRAMEWORK Metal)
    find_library(METALKIT_FRAMEWORK MetalKit)
  elseif(WIN32)
    # DirectX SDK is included in Windows SDK
  elseif(UNIX AND NOT APPLE)
    # OpenGL loader (glad or similar)
    FetchContent_Declare(
      glad
      GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad.git
      GIT_TAG v0.1.36
    )
  endif()
endif()
```

### Dependency Rules

- **IMPORTANT**: Use CMake's `FetchContent` for all editor dependencies
- **DO NOT**: Copy external libraries into the repository
- **Scope**: Dependencies should only be fetched when building the editor target
- **Core Library**: Must remain dependency-free
